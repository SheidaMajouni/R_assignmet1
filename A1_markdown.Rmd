## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Loading libraries
```{r}
library(datasauRus)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
# search() check which library are loaded
# or library(dplyr, ggplot2)
```
## dataset head and overview
```{r dataset dozen}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
count(dataset) # count from dplyr library
```

## Data visualization and summary
```{r}
# from data set load dino using pipe code
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>% filter(dataset == "dino")

# plot it
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +  geom_point() # map axis x to column x, use point as the shape
```
```{r}
dino_data %>%  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
